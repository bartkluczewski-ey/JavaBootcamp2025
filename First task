First task is about installing hit locally, creating github account and then creating private repo with
 name "BootCamp2025" with README file. Now I am creating 3 text files which contain details about 3 different tasks.
 Later i will clone repo locally and create development branch and
commit with push changes to repo. Later on I will work on developoment branch, create Pull Requests to main branch and add reviewers.
